# React project boilerplate

Becomes utterly useful when it comes to bootstrapping a new project. Includes all required technologies/modules of a descent React app. All packages are updated periodically.

## Packages

Used technology stack:

1. React v16

2. React CSS Modules

3. Redux v4

4. Webpack v4

5. Babel

6. ESLint

7. Stylelint

## Run scripts

* `npm start` - runs Webpack in production mode and launches Express app
* `npm run dev` - runs Webpack dev server in dev mode
* `npm run build` - runs Webpack to make build in /public directory
* `npm run lint` - runs ESLint to get errors/warnings
* `npm run fix` - runs ESLint to fix errors/warnings if any

## TODO's

* add testing with Jest and Enzym
* add Prepack for run optimizations
* add React-router
* add Autoprefixer
* compare with create-react-app
